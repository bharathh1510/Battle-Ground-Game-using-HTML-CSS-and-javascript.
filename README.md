# Battle-Ground-Game-using-HTML-CSS-and-javascript.

This is a project created using HTML, CSS and javascript. Here we use CSS to display buttons, text boxes, background images , styling to design the page. 

I have used javascript for displaying various text messages, altering the XP, Health and Gold remaining with the human. Multiple functions are used for calling different functionality in the battle. Random function is used to generate number of gold coins and loose health during the fight. 

Steps on executing the project :
  - Clone the repository to your system.
  - Open the HTML file using any browser.
  - If any errors arise, please check the filenames and paths.
